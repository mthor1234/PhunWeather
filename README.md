# PhunWeather

Create a list-based application that allows the user to fetch weather information from a weather services API of your choice. The user should be able to add/remove zip codes from the list. Please focus effort on the weather services API interface. The application UI should be functional â€“ it doesn't have to be pretty.

Once you have completed the assignment to the best of your ability please send Paul Clark a link to a GitHub or BitBucket repository containing the project. You will be required to present your project assignment. The presentation and questions shouldn't last longer than 30 minutes. 

Your presentation should encompass the following:
Summary detailing project requirements
Detail challenges experienced
Walk through code implementation
Detail improvements you would make if you had additional time.
