# PhunWeather

PhunWeather is a weather forecast Android application. It provdes an up-to-date, six day weather forecast.
The user can store a list of different zip codes and fetch weather forecast information for each zip code.

Phunware Project Description

Create a list-based application that allows the user to fetch weather information from a weather services API of your choice. The user should be able to add/remove zip codes from the list. Please focus effort on the weather services API interface. The application UI should be functional â€“ it doesn't have to be pretty.
